## üõ†Ô∏è App Flow

### **Landing Page**
![Landing Page](https://github.com/rashadalh/Avalocks/blob/main/Photos/Landing.PNG)

Upon opening the app, the user lands on the welcome screens. These screens introduce the app with some visual flair, leading to the main login or sign-in screen. The user sees the app logo and is guided to enter the app.

### **Sign-In**
![Sign-In](https://github.com/rashadalh/Avalocks/blob/main/Photos/Signin.PNG)

The user is prompted to either create an account or log in with their existing credentials. The login process is simple and straightforward, ensuring easy access to the app. The app includes password recovery options and account registration options.

### **Add Wallet via Coinbase**
![Add Wallet](https://github.com/rashadalh/Avalocks/blob/main/Photos/AddCBWallet.PNG)

After logging in, users can add their wallets for tracking and permission management. This is where they integrate their Coinbase Smart Wallet or another supported wallet on Ethereum or Layer 2 networks. Users select their wallet and add it to the tracker for further interaction.

### **Wallet Health Score**
![Wallet Health Score](https://github.com/rashadalh/Avalocks/blob/main/Photos/WalletHealthScore.PNG)

Once the wallet is added, the app presents the Wallet Health Score. This feature evaluates the risk of permissions associated with the wallet, providing users with a clear understanding of the security risks involved. The dashboard displays various wallet statuses and suggests when permissions should be revoked.

### **Prompt Permission Revocation**
![Prompt Revoke](https://github.com/rashadalh/Avalocks/blob/main/Photos/PromptRevoke.PNG)

When the app identifies at-risk permissions, it prompts the user to revoke them. With a simple interface, the user selects which permissions to revoke and confirms the action, all while maintaining security through session key technology. The user can revoke all permissions at once or specify which ones to revoke.

### **Individual Wallet Insights**

In addition to the overall health score, users can view detailed insights for individual wallets. Each wallet's permissions are analyzed, and the user is given a breakdown of why specific permissions may be at risk. The interface allows users to see the amount at risk and why, offering transparency and control over each wallet.

## üìñ Product Overview

### The Challenge of Managing Permissions
In the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, users are often required to grant permissions to smart contracts for their wallets to interact with decentralized applications (dApps). Over time, these permissions accumulate and become potential attack vectors for malicious actors, creating significant security risks. 

While users are often unaware of these vulnerabilities, the process of revoking permissions has traditionally been convoluted and technical, requiring substantial effort. **Avalocks** was created to streamline and simplify this process.

### Introducing Avalocks
Avalocks is an automation-driven mobile-first application that aggregates all wallet permissions across Ethereum and its Layer 2 networks in one interface. Powered by Ava Protocol's decentralized automation engine and integrated with Coinbase Smart Wallet's Session Key functionality, Avalocks simplifies the revocation process into a user-friendly, accessible experience. 

- No technical know-how required.
- Security through simplicity.
- All permission data in one accessible interface.

## üß© Use Case Explanation

### The Problem:
As the Ethereum ecosystem expands and matures, users interact with a growing number of dApps that require wallet permissions. These permissions often remain active long after the initial interaction, creating potential vulnerabilities as outdated permissions could be exploited.

### The Solution:
**Avalocks** addresses this problem by providing a unified, mobile-first platform where users can revoke unnecessary permissions with ease. By using Coinbase Smart Wallet's Session Key technology, users can revoke permissions without exposing their private keys, all while leveraging Ava Protocol's decentralized automation infrastructure.

- **Security**: Users can revoke outdated permissions across multiple networks without needing extensive technical knowledge.
- **Ease of Use**: Revoking permissions is as easy as typing a simple command or clicking a button.
- **Real-Time Protection**: Users receive immediate feedback on wallet risks and can act accordingly.

### Why Now:
With decentralized finance and Web3 adoption on the rise, especially among young populations in countries like India, Nigeria, and Indonesia, there's a pressing need for mobile-first solutions that make blockchain interactions secure and user-friendly. **Avalocks** meets this need head-on by simplifying a critical aspect of wallet security.

## üìä Data-Driven Validation

### Market Insights:
- **Crypto Adoption in Emerging Markets**: Countries like India, Nigeria, and Indonesia are leading the charge in crypto adoption, with millions of users engaging with DeFi and NFT platforms on mobile devices.
- **Wallet Vulnerabilities**: Many users are unaware of the security risks posed by outdated wallet permissions, leading to an increased risk of unauthorized access. 

According to **Chainalysis**, over 2023, the number of crypto hacking incidents increased despite a reduction in the total value stolen. Many of these incidents targeted DeFi protocols, underscoring the importance of security. However, significant drops in DeFi-related hacks in the latter part of 2023 also highlight the potential of improved security practices, something **Avalocks** aims to contribute to by offering enhanced permission control.

  
**Avalocks** is designed with these insights in mind, addressing the specific needs of young, mobile-first users in rapidly growing markets. By simplifying wallet permission management, **Avalocks** is poised to enhance security for millions of users.
